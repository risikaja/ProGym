            <h1>THE 5 BEST CHEST EXERCISES THAT SHOULD BE IN EVERY CHEST WORKOUT</h1>
        </div>
    </section>


    <section class="news">
        <div>
        <p>No day divides the genders more than Chest Day: Whilst men count down the days until they bench again, women often steer clear of the day altogether.

            It’s no surprise, really: Do a quick search, and you’ll find videos of built, topless men flexing through their favorite chest exercises. After all, a round, popping chest like Carlos Belcast is what many men dream of.
            
            But despite what you may think, training the chest isn't just for the bro-splitters—and it’s not just for aesthetics either: A strong chest is essential for good posture (especially if you’re putting in time to train your back and spend a large part of your day desk-bound). It’s also the secret to building strength in some of the best (but often most challenging) movements, from bench press to pull-ups.
            
            But love it or hate it, chest exercises are something that everyone should be doing. And one thing’s for sure: However much you love (or hate) chest day, you want to attack it in the most time-efficient way possible – which is much easier said than done.
            
            Luckily, we know that the best chest workouts are well-structured, focused, and, most importantly, don’t take all day. We’ve put together the ultimate guide, giving everything you need to know about the chest muscles and sharing the secrets of the best chest exercises guaranteed to build strength, size, and power.</p>

            <h3>WHAT ARE THE CHEST MUSCLES?</h3>

            <img src="./images/news-4.jpg" alt="news img" class="news-img">

            <p>If you’re chasing a pumped chest to fill your muscle fit shirt (or perk up your chest in that sports bra), then let us tell you that things would be a whole lot easier if you understood the specifics of what you’re actually working on underneath that t-shirt.

                The chest is made up of two muscle groups:
                
                The Pectoralis Major (attached to the front of the body on the rib cage. This muscle helps to move the shoulder joint and attaches the arms to the body.)
                
                The Pectoralis Minor (sits underneath the Pectoralis Major and helps to move the shoulder forward.)
                
                Within these muscles, there are three different areas of the chest:
                
                The Upper Chest (Clavicular Head)
                
                The Inner Chest (or Mid Chest / Sternal head)
                
                The Lower Chest (Abdominal Head)
                
                When performing chest exercises, you’ll be hitting each area of the chest rather than one at a time. You can, however, emphasize different areas 
                depending on the angle of the exercise; for example, your upper chest is best worked using incline pressing exercises, the inner chest pressing on a flat bench, whereas the lower chest is targeted using decline pressing movements.</p>

                <h3>WHAT ARE THE BEST CHEST EXERCISES TO BUILD YOUR CHEST?</h3>

                <p>Many physique-oriented lifters start by focusing overly on the inner chest. Don’t worry—we’re not pointing fingers, and we don’t blame you—but if you’re after puffed-up pecs, you need to start focusing on all three areas of the chest.

                    But how do you do that? Well, you likely know that pressing exercises are great for building the chest, but did you know you should also include adduction exercises in your chest fitness training program? These involve bringing your arms together towards the midline of your body, hitting those chest muscles from a different angle.
                    
                    Luckily, our best chest exercises take this into account, giving the perfect balance of exercises to work each part of the chest and from different angles, too. Add these to your chest and tricep workout, or sprinkle them into the mix on shoulder day, and you’ll be seeing results pretty quickly. </p>

                    <h3>FLAT BARBELL BENCH PRESS</h3>
                    <p>Not only is the bench press a great chest builder, but building strength in this movement is probably one of the biggest ego boosts out there. Nothing beats the feeling of loading up those 45lb plates, moving under the bar, and pressing it with ease. And nothing earns you much more respect in the lifting world, either.

                        The barbell bench press is a great inner chest workout, but it also recruits muscle fibers from the entire chest, alongside assistance from the anterior deltoid (shoulder) and triceps.
                        
                        You can also perform the bench press using a pair of dumbbells, but using a barbell is often favored because it allows the muscle groups to work as one, moving the bar away from the torso before controlling the eccentric portion of the rep. The barbell also allows more weight to be added to the bar compared to a flat dumbbell bench press, making it an excellent exercise for increasing overall strength and power.
                        
                        Tip: Grasp the bar slightly wider than shoulder width. Your elbow, forearm, and wrist should all be in line at the bottom of the movement.
                        
                        Whether you’re a beginner looking to master the bench press or an advanced lifter looking to take your pressing to the next level, check out our top 5 tips to improve your bench press.</p>
