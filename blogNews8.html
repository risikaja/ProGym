        <p>When it comes to the best foods to eat before the gym, it's safe to say the abundance of information online can be relatively confusing.

            From high carbs to no carbs, what should you eat before the gym to give your body the fuel it needs to exercise at a high intensity?
            
            Nutrition is generally overlooked when it comes to going to the gym, and can be a difficult topic to understand when it comes to deciding what is best for you. After all, we're all different, and there's no one-size fits all approach.
            
            In this article, we'll look at whether you should eat before the gym and what the best types of food are to eat before your workouts.
            
            We'll also answer some of the most common questions about eating before the gym, along with a list of 6 fantastic snacks that can help fuel the toughest of gym workouts.</p>

            <h3>Factors that may determine how you fuel your workouts include</h3>

            <img src="./images/news-8.jpg" alt="news img" class="news-img">

            <p>Before we delve deeper into this topic, it's important to consider a few personal factors when determining what you should eat before working out.

                These factors will help you better decide your food choices, and how you plan what you to eat before working out, along with your general eating habits for your meals throughout the day.
                 Current calorie intakes or dietary goals, such as keto or low carb

                Eating habits, such as fasting for periods of the day
                
                Training phase and workout intensity/duration
                
                These above factors may help to determine what to eat before a workout, in line with your goals.
                
                As always, before making any changes to your diet, it is best to consult with a registered professional or doctor.</p>

                <h3>HOW LONG BEFORE WORKING OUT SHOULD YOU EAT?</h3>

                <p>When we exercise, our body uses three different energy systems depending on the workout's intensity, speed, and length. Without going too in-depth about these energy systems, they all overlap to create energy to keep your body performing at its best as the demand we place on it varies.

                    Two of these energy systems (anaerobic and aerobic) rely on glycolysis, whilst the third is for much shorter bursts of energy, called the ATP-PC System.

                    The anaerobic and aerobic systems use carbohydrates and fats to replenish energy stores and allow the body to continue exercising and retain the ability to carry out daily functions.

                    The energy used here is from eating and digesting food, mainly from carbohydrates and fats.

                    So why is this important to know?

                        
                    Your body can start extracting small amounts of energy from low glycemic carbohydrates, such as fruit, grainy bread, and oats, within 15-30 minutes of consuming the foods. Elevating your blood glucose levels and beginning to store this energy in your muscles, in the form of glycogen.

                    However, to fully digest these complex carbohydrates, it can take multiple hours – and there's nothing worse than training on a full or bloated stomach.</p>

                    <h3>WHAT SHOULD I EAT 30 MINUTES BEFORE A WORKOUT?</h3>
                    <p>So, we've established that proper nutrition and a comprehensive diet plan will allow you to eat well in advance of your workouts and is typically the best approach when it comes to eating before your workout.

                        But what if you haven't had a chance to have a big meal? Or you are simply hungry and feel better heading into a workout knowing you've got some energy in the tank...
                        
                        Eating 30 minutes before a workout can aid in providing immediate glycogen (energy), replenishing any loss in energy stores since your last meal time, and can help prime the metabolism.
                        
                        Eating too little or too much can have a negative impact on your performance and how you feel – so finding a personal balance of quantity and nutritionally dense foods could have a positive impact on your workouts.</p>
