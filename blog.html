                <p class="card-description-custom">
                    The case of the runner’s knee (also known as patellofemoral pain (PFP) is an injury that is overlooked by many on their quest to keep up their running streak.

                    But between all the miles racked up from roadrunning, and possibly not having enough days off, it's easy to see why running would take its toll on your knees.

                    Oftentimes, a knee injury is an easy fix, healed over time dedicated to rest and recovery. [...]

                    Whether you wear tank tops year-round, or the summer months are when you let your biceps shine, men’s tank tops are a great look, in and out of the gym. It’s time to swap out your familiar gym t-shirt for a sleeveless number and sport an arm-baring tank top on your next upper body workout.

Men’s tank tops are a great choice of gym kit to wear for lifting, running, hybrid workouts and yoga. They help keep you cool [...]

                    We might obsess over building bulging biceps or glutes that pop, but turn your attention to shoulder exercises, and you’ve suddenly got a workout that makes you look athletic, built, and strong AF. Gains aside, broadening out up top will boost strength for your other lifts, help with stability, and lessen the chance of injury.

                    No day divides the genders more than Chest Day: Whilst men count down the days until they bench again, women often steer clear of the day altogether.

                It’s no surprise, really: Do a quick search, and you’ll find videos of built, topless men flexing through their favorite chest exercises. After all, a round, popping chest like Carlos Belcast is what many men dream of. [...]

In order to stay on the path you have chosen, it's a good start to have an overview of what you should be doing.

                    So if you’re wondering how often you should go to the gym, it’s worth breaking down your goals. Then, the time you’re committing, and what you’re doing when you’re there, will match up. By kickstarting your routine, you  [...]
