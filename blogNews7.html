            <h1>HOW OFTEN SHOULD I GO TO THE GYM?</h1>
        </div>
    </section>


    <section class="news">
        <div>
        <p>It feels like a question with no real answer — how often should I go to the gym? Perhaps you've committed yourself to the idea of losing weight, or even already joined a gym. In order to stay on the path you have chosen, it's a good start to have an overview of what you should be doing.

            So if you’re wondering how often you should go to the gym, it’s worth breaking down your goals. Then, the time you’re committing, and what you’re doing when you’re there, will match up. By kickstarting your routine, you need to put together a schedule that fits around you and your goals, along with something that isn’t putting a strain on your health.
            
            Fitness, wellness, and nutrition expert Penny Weston, a wellness entrepreneur, the director of Moddershall Oaks Country Spa Retreat, and founder of MADE, a 360-degree wellness center, has helped us to break down the confusion around the question ‘how often should I go to the gym?’
            
            Personalized blends of cardio, strength training, core work, stretching, and rest, will all help you achieve your goals over time. It’s simply about getting over the hurdle of knowing what you need to do.</p>

            <h3>HOW OFTEN SHOULD I GO TO THE GYM?</h3>

            <img src="./images/news-7.jpg" alt="news img" class="news-img">

            <p>There isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer to how often anybody should go to the gym. Simply put, how often you go to the gym depends on your goals — gaining muscle, losing weight, keeping more often, on your health, and your lifestyle.

                Penny says “I generally advise people to work out at the gym three to five times a week, for about 45 minutes to an hour. If you really want to see results and make progress over time, you need to work out at least four to five days per week, but it will take time to build up to this.”
                
                It's important to note that if you're a beginner, you need to make sure you don't overdo it. Starting off with around two days a week, and slowly increasing the number of weekly sessions, will help you adjust mentally, and physically.</p>

                <h3>HOW FREQUENTLY SHOULD A BEGINNER GO TO THE GYM?</h3>

                <p>Starting off, heading to the gym around two days a week is a great way to start. It will help your mind adjust to the fact that this is something you’re going to be doing more than just once a week, and get your body into the swing of things.

                    A good balance is always key. Studies have shown that a combination of cardio and weight training can actually help you to live healthier, and longer.
                    
                    Splitting the amount of time you spend at the gym into goals will help you decide how much time you need to commit. Penny explains how each goal will require different commitments.</p>

                    <h3>TO INCREASE FITNESS AND GENERAL HEALTH</h3>
                    <p>To increase your general fitness, you should go to the gym four to five times a week. This allows for a balanced workout routine, and allows your body time to recover between workouts.

                        If your goal is for endurance or burning calories, three days of cardio and two days of strength training would be ideal. If your goal is building strength, you can reverse that, and can also switch it each week. For building muscle, you want to focus on two muscle groups per session and to not work on the same muscles two days in a row as you want to allow them time to recover. Three to four visits to the gym a week would be optimum for building muscle.

                        Studies show that training a minimum of two days per week is needed to maximize muscle growth.</p>
