        <div>
        <p>Technology, in particular our smartphones, play a key role in our daily lives.

            And it's no different when it comes to well-being. Utilizing applications on our phones and wearable tech can be a great way to manage and boost our well-being, both physically and mentally.
            
            The popularity of well-being apps and wearable tech has allowed us to meditate, track our sleep, and exercise better than ever, so when it comes to choosing the right wellness apps, it can be a bit of a minefield with so many to choose from.
            
            This article puts together some of the best well-being apps to help level up your health and wellness, whether that's taking five minutes during a hectic day for a guided meditation, or trying a new leg workout.</p>

            <h3>FOR ALL-IN-ONE MINDFULNESS</h3>

            <img src="./images/news-6.jpg" alt="news img" class="news-img">

            <p>"Calm is the #1 app for Sleep, Meditation and Relaxation. Sleep better, relieve stress, lower anxiety and refocus your attention."

                If you're looking for the best mindfulness app that does it all, from daily meditation to helping you drift off at bed time, then the Calm app is a great option.
                
                Whether you just need to take a breather and have some me-time, or want to experience a longer guided meditation, the Calm app is certainly worth a try.
                
                From reducing stress and anxiety to self-improvement, guided meditations, and improved sleep, there's something in Calm for everyone.</p>

                <h3>FOR HELPING YOU GET TO SLEEP:</h3>

                <p>Tracking your sleep length and phases is great, but sometimes the first challenge is relaxing and falling asleep.

                    Sleep sounds and scientifically proven audio, such as ASMR and isochronic brainwaves, help you drift off to sleep more easily, creating lasting sleep habits.
                    
                    If that's not enough, Better Sleep can also track your sleep phases, record noises during your sleep, and helps teach you the science behind your unique sleep needs.</p>

                    <h3>FOR MONITORING YOUR RECOVERY AND READINESS TO TRAIN</h3>
                    <p>You've probably heard of a few wearable tech devices that can help track your exercise exertion and recovery, but if you have a smartwatch, there are apps that can do this too.
