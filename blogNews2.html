        <div>
        <p>Whether you wear tank tops year-round, or the summer months are when you let your biceps shine, men’s tank tops are a great look, in and out of the gym. It’s time to swap out your familiar gym t-shirt for a sleeveless number and sport an arm-baring tank top on your next upper body workout.

            Men’s tank tops are a great choice of gym kit to wear for lifting, running, hybrid workouts and yoga. They help keep you cool and allow your arms to move easily in all directions thanks to their sleeveless silhouette, and of course, they’re not bad for flexing your gym pump. But what workout tank is best for you?
            
            We’ve got the roundup of the best gym tank tops for men; from sweat-wicking tank tops for running, to slim-fit muscle tanks, and the best tank for lifting, plus we explain the differences between the types of tank tops so that you can find your next summer workout ‘fit. </p>

            <h3>TYPES OF TANKS</h3>

            <img src="./images/news-2.jpg" alt="news img" class="news-img">

            <p>The simple tank top comes in a variety of different styles to suit your style preference and workout needs, and they all fit in different ways. Drop arm tanks are airy and non-restrictive, making them a great choice for workouts where you are working through a large range of motion. If hypertrophy is your main goal, and appearance and aesthetics are everything to you, then it might be a muscle-fit tank you choose, that fits tight to the body and enhances your physique. There’s a tank for everyone, find out the differences below.

                Drop Arm Tank - Typically cut in a slim or regular fit, and features low arm-holes that hang low on the torso that show off the lats and obliques and a regular crew-neck neckline.

Muscle Tank - Feature wide straps or slight cap sleeves, and a looser longer fit. Muscle tanks fully cover the back and torso with a racerback design and a higher neckline.

Racerback Tank - The racerback shape helps you move freely and can be found across multiple styles of tank tops.

Muscle Fit Tank - These are form-fitting, scoop-neck tanks often made from a ribbed fabric.

Stringer - Typically used for lifting, they feature very thin straps, low armholes, and an extreme racerback to highlight back muscles.

                <h3>THE BEST GYM TANK TOPS FOR MEN</h3>

Don’t deny yourself of a cooler workout option in the warmer months, vests are for everyone whether you’re a beginner in weightlifting or you’re well-versed in training for mass.
