            <h1>YOUR ULTIMATE GUIDE TO HACK SQUATS, PLUS THE BEST VARIATIONS</h1>

        <p>Eye-popping quads are gold in the bodybuilding world, and Tom Platz has made sure of that.

            But whilst many associate Tom Platz’s thick thighs with squats, if you’re really looking to pack some muscle on your legs, then it’s time to start prioritising hack squats in your leg day workout.
            
            They’re heavy, effective and you’ll look pretty good doing them – all of these are reasons why the hack squat machine is a staple in bodybuilding gyms. If you want to load your quads, lift heavy, and look strong, the hack squat is your exercise.
            
            If you’re ready to get some serious size on your thighs then stay with us as we break down this ultimate quad-builder. Plus, we’ll look at some variations, so even if you don’t have access to a hack squat machine, you can still benefit from this monster leg exercise.</p>

            <h3>WHAT IS A HACK SQUAT?</h3>

            <img src="./images/news-5.jpg" alt="news img" class="news-img">

            <p>Despite the exercise creeping up on our social feeds more frequently, the hack squat is not a new invention. In fact, it’s been around since the early 1900s as a trusted method of building strength, speed, power, and agility [1]. Its creation is credited to weightlifter and wrestler, George Hackenschmidt, who lifted 187lb on his back, with his knees bent. He realized the squat adaptation allowed a heavier weight to be lifted without load on the spine, which became known as the ‘Hack Squat’. Today, the hack squat machine is a staple in most bodybuilding gyms.

                As an exercise, the hack squat lies somewhere between a barbell squat and a leg press – the upright body position and weight loading mimicking that of a barbell squat, whilst the stability 
                
                of the machine mimics the leg press. The hack squat is usually performed on a hack squat machine, where the lifter stands on a plate and the weight rests on their shoulders. The lifter squats down, and then pushes the weight up, driving through their feet.</p>

                <h3>CORE ENGAGEMENT DURING HACK SQUAT</h3>

                <p>Whilst core engagement is required to protect the lower spine and back during the movement, it’s important to note that due to support of the upper body from the machine, core muscle activation is lower during the hack squat compared to a barbell squat [3].

                    A benefit of this is that it allows for heavier loads to be lifted, making the hack squat well suited to those with aesthetic goals (e.g. bodybuilders purely wanting to focus on leg gains).
                    
                    However, If your overarching goal is performance-based (e.g. building athleticism for a sport), then a free weight squat (barbell or goblet squat) may be more beneficial, providing more challenge for core stability, balance, and muscle coordination – important skills in many sports.</p>

                    <h3>HACK SQUAT FOOT PLACEMENT</h3>
                    <p>Where you place your feet on the platform can affect muscle activation. Whilst no research has been done specifically into foot placement during the hack squat, studies have examined foot placement during the leg press, which could be applied to the hack squat. They found that placing the feet lower on the platform led to greater quad activation, whereas higher foot placement on the platform activated the glutes more [6]. In terms of stance width, activation was found to be just as effective during both a narrow and wide stance [7].

                        Experiment with placing your feet lower or higher on the platform depending on if you want to fully focus on quad development, or engage the glutes more.</p>
