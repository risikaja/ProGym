            <h1>THE BEST SHOULDER EXERCISES TO BUILD BIG SHOULDERS</h1>
        </div>
    </section>


    <section class="news">
        <div>
        <p>We might obsess over building bulging biceps or glutes that pop, but turn your attention to shoulder exercises, and you’ve suddenly got a workout that makes you look athletic, built, and strong AF. Gains aside, broadening out up top will boost strength for your other lifts, help with stability, and lessen the chance of injury.

            But getting the shoulders of dreams takes hard work. And if you’re fed up with not seeing progress after a few rows and raises, maybe it’s time to mix up your shoulder workout…
            
            In fact, to really build sculpted shoulders, you need to hit all the major muscles in the shoulder joint (yes, there are multiple) — and from different angles, too.
            
            So, if you’re committed to growing big shoulders, then listen up: we’re going to give you every detail you need to know to build delts to die for. A quick anatomy lesson, some fast-fire facts about why you should be training, and all the details on shoulder workout warm-ups and cool-downs. Oh, and of course, the best shoulder exercises to build big shoulders.
            
            So get ready: Things are about to get heavy.</p>

            <h3>WHY SHOULD YOU DO SHOULDER WORKOUTS?</h3>

            <img src="./images/news-3.jpg" alt="news img" class="news-img">

            <p>They may not be the strongest muscle group in the body, but dedicating time to shoulder exercises will massively benefit your lifting, improve your posture, and keep your shoulder health in tip-top shape. Not only are the shoulder muscles involved during overhead movements, such as the overhead shoulder press but they play a key role in aiding stability in pushing and pulling exercises. 
                Not to mention the aesthetic benefits – do we need to mention how good shapely shoulders look in a tank top or halterneck bra? If it’s the v-shape torso you’re after, you’ll want to start putting more graft into your shoulder workouts. And if you’re stepping on stage anytime soon, big shoulders are guaranteed to win you points.</p>

                <h3>WHAT MUSCLES ARE IN THE SHOULDERS?</h3>

                <p>Feeling convinced? Before we delve into our shoulder workout, we need to understand exactly what the shoulder muscles are.

                    The shoulder is a complicated joint containing multiple layers of superficial and deep muscle tissue.
                    
                    The major muscles in the shoulder joint include:
                    
                    Rotator Cuff
                    
                    Deltoid
                    
                    Rhomboids
                    
                    Trapezius </p>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9SzlYxuOSpg?si=Ft3JeUYz_BMu5QG1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                   <p> So now you know what muscles you need to train to build your shoulders, it’s time to move on to the best shoulder exercises. This is where careful planning comes in: It’s very easy to slip into the habit of doing the same shoulder exercises again and again, but shoulder workouts take careful planning to ensure each and every muscle gets the attention it needs. Focus too much on one and neglect another, and you’re unlikely to get those well-rounded shoulders you crave (and risk injury and imbalances!).

                    So to ensure we are developing well-rounded shoulders, we’ll guide you through a variety of shoulder exercises, hitting different muscles from different angles.</p>
