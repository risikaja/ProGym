        <div>
        <p>The case of the runner’s knee (also known as patellofemoral pain (PFP) is an injury that is overlooked by many on their quest to keep up their running streak.

            But between all the miles racked up from roadrunning, and possibly not having enough days off, it's easy to see why running would take its toll on your knees.
            
            Oftentimes, a knee injury is an easy fix, healed over time dedicated to rest and recovery. But bulletproofing your knees with a stretching and strengthening routine will take you those extra miles and help prevent further injury or pain later down the line.
            
            As much as you want to keep on running, it's best not to ignore those niggling knee pains. Instead, incorporate knee-strengthening exercises into your regular resistance training routines, warm-ups, and cool-down routines.
            
            Before we get into the exercises you should be doing to strengthen this joint, we'll explore how exactly the runner’s knee is caused, and the anatomy of the knee, so you can understand what muscles you’re using when you run, and how to protect them.</p>

            <h3>WHAT ARE THE MUSCLES IN THE KNEE?</h3>

            <img src="./images/news-1.jpg" alt="news img" class="news-img">

            <p>Runner’s knee generally refers to pain in the muscles that attach to the patella ligament at the front of your knee, also known as the anterior knee.

                The muscles in the knee are made up of two large muscle groups - the hamstrings that are found behind the knee (posterior) and the quadriceps that join to the front of your knee (anterior) and across the femur.
                
                The four muscles of the quadriceps that control extension of the knee are:
                
                Rectus Femoris
                
                Vastus Lateralis
                
                Vastus Medialis
                
                Vastus Intermedius
                
                The hamstrings function as knee flexors to bend your knee and are made up of the following three muscles:
                
                Semitendinosus
                
                Semimembranosus
                
                Biceps Femoris
                
                Knee pain from running will norm
                
                ally be experienced at the front of the knee which will be felt directly around or behind the patella, whereas if you have pain inside the knee this could indicate bone bruising or an injury to the medial meniscus cartilage which runs through the inside of the knee cap.
                
                Any pain on the side of your knee could be the result of an IT band tear or more serious injury to the lateral part of the knee down to LCL injury, or lateral meniscus tear.</p>

                <h3>10 KNEE STRENGTHENING EXERCISES FOR RUNNERS</h3>

                <p>Knee strengthening exercises take into account your entire upper leg muscles. Think of it like a domino effect, if your quads are stronger, your hips will be stronger, which will also make your knees stronger, and the same applies to the hamstrings. Developing hamstring and quadricep strength improves knee flexion, stability, and hip flexion.

                    Targeting the core will also help to improve your balance and stabilize your body so that your knees aren't under so much pressure, minimizing the risk of injury and pain.
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9SzlYxuOSpg?si=Ft3JeUYz_BMu5QG1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    So we've put together a series of ten knee-strengthening exercises for runners to strengthen the knee joint and surrounding muscles.
                    
                    These exercises can be performed together as part of a stretching routine, we recommend repeating each exercise 2-3 times.</p>

                    

                    <p>Incorporating knee-strengthening exercises into your weekly routines can help strengthen the muscles around your knees, leading to improved stability and reducing the risk of injury.

                        If you've just started running, it's even more crucial you focus on stability and mobility so you don't have to suffer from runner's knee later down the line. But no matter where you are in your running journey, it's important not to neglect strengthening the knees so you can run your best, not just at the beginning of your run, but at the last mile too.</p>
